  "INTRO": "Introduction",
  "INTRO-1": "Protecting sensitive information from improper disclosure or corruption is a longstanding, fundamental goal of computer security: but it is one that is not currently being achieved well at all, as is evident from continual news reports of large-scale data compromises. Such compromises result from many causes, of course. Sometimes the compromises are essentially social, as in “phishing” attacks: users are led to fraudulent websites and tricked into disclosing their authentication credentials there, enabling attackers to impersonate them and to gain access to their sensitive data. Other compromises are more technical, resulting from flaws (both malicious and inadvertent) in the design and implementation of computer systems that process sensitive data.",
  "INTRO-2": "Imagine a system that is given some sensitive information as input and then, as it processes it, somehow produces some publicly observable output. The output might be the result of the computation, intentionally made public, or it might be some aspect of the computation itself, such as time taken, or energy used, or number of cache faults — such outputs, often unintentional, are called side channels. A basic question that we wish to answer is whether the system causes some of the sensitive information to “flow” from the input to the observable output, thereby causing “leakage” of that information — and of course we need to understand precisely what that means."
