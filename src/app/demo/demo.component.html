<span>Suppose that a secret called X is generated by
  rolling a pair of distinguishable dice, one red and one white. Then the set X of possible
  values of X has 36 elements.
</span><br>
<span>
  We suppose that a channel C takes as input the value (r,w)
  of X and outputs the sum of the two dice, so that C(r,w) = r+w. (From a security
  perspective, we can think of C as a malicious program that leaks the sum of the digits
  of a PIN.)
