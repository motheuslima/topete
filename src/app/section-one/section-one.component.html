  <h1>A first discussion of information leakage</h1>
  <span>
    In this section we discuss information leakage in a “toy” system, chosen to make the analysis relatively simple.  </span>

    <h2>Secrets</h2>
  <span>
    Let us consider a simple example. Suppose that a secret called X is generated by rolling a pair of distinguishable dice, one red and one white. Then the set X of possiblevalues of X has 36 elements, as shown here:  </span>

  <span>We can write each such value more compactly as a pair (r,w), where r is the value of the red die and w is the value of the white die. (From a security perspective, we can think of X as a two-digit PIN, where the digits are limited to numbers from 1 to 6.)</span>
  <span>What does it mean to say that X is a secret with respect to an adversary? We take that to mean that the adversary knows only a probability distribution π that specifies the probability πx of each possible value x of X.What does it mean to say that X is a secret with respect to an adversary? We take that to mean that the adversary knows only a probability distribution π that specifies the probability πx of each possible value x of X.</span>
  <span>If we assume here that the two dice are fair and independent, then in fact π
    will be uniform, i.e. will be such that πx=πx′ for all x, x′ in X. As a mnemonic, we
    will usually write ϑ for the uniform distribution, generic in X, 1 so that in this case
    the probability 1/36 is assigned to each outcome: that is,
    ϑ(1,1) = ϑ(1,2) = ϑ(1,3) = · · · = ϑ(6,6) = 1/36 .
    In general (i.e. whether it is uniform or not) we refer to the above as a prior distribution,
    because it reflects the adversary’s knowledge about X before observing the output of
    a system. Later we will discuss posterior distributions, which reflect the adversary’s
    knowledge after observing the output.</span>
