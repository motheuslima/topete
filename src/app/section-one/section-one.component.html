    In this section we discuss information leakage in a “toy” system, chosen to make the analysis relatively simple.  </span>
  <span>
    Let us consider a simple example. Suppose that a secret called X is generated by rolling a pair of distinguishable dice, one red and one white. Then the set X of possiblevalues of X has 36 elements, as shown here:  </span>

  <span>We can write each such value more compactly as a pair (r,w), where r is the value of the red die and w is the value of the white die. (From a security perspective, we can think of X as a two-digit PIN, where the digits are limited to numbers from 1 to 6.)</span>
  <span>What does it mean to say that X is a secret with respect to an adversary? We take that to mean that the adversary knows only a probability distribution π that specifies the probability πx of each possible value x of X.What does it mean to say that X is a secret with respect to an adversary?
